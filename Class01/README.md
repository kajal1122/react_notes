React and ReactDOM is two different thing , created to handle different case --- React is base and React DOM is built for DOM manipulation for web apps. 

-- Working on react routes 
    - need to use createBrowserRouter from react don
    -- need to define paths and elements in createBrowserRouter
    -- In order to handle error case , we can use errorElement 
    -- we get hook useRouteError() from react-router-dom that can help to get error object defining 
    -- Link can be used to route to different pages without making page reload or browser refresh 
    --- Links are also provided by react-route-dom
    -- Diiffrence between client side routing and server side routing 
    -- In client side routing , we are not makeing new network calls to fetch html pages and load on screen but in server side 
    we need to fetch html pages from server and load on browser .
